# Web Mesh Visualizer

A dynamic web-based visualization tool that combines face mesh tracking with audio-reactive effects and interactive particle systems. This project creates an immersive visual experience that responds to both facial movements and music.

## Features

- Real-time face mesh tracking using MediaPipe
- Audio-reactive visualizations that respond to music
- Interactive particle system that responds to mouse movements
- Support for multiple audio sources including built-in songs and custom MP3 uploads
- Dynamic color effects and animations
- Camera selection and control
- Beautiful UI with gradient effects and smooth animations

## Technologies Used

- [MediaPipe Face Mesh](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh) - For face tracking
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) - For 3D visualizations
- [particles.js](https://vincentgarreau.com/particles.js/) - For interactive particle effects
- Web Audio API - For audio analysis and visualization

## Project Goals

This project aims to create an engaging visual experience that combines several modern web technologies:

1. **Face Tracking**: Using MediaPipe's face mesh technology to track facial features in real-time
2. **Audio Reactivity**: Creating visual effects that respond to music frequencies and intensity
3. **Interactive Elements**: Adding particle systems that respond to user interaction
4. **Visual Aesthetics**: Implementing smooth animations and gradient effects for a polished look

The result is a tool that can be used for:
- Live performances
- Music visualization
- Interactive art installations
- Educational demonstrations of web technologies

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Allow camera access when prompted
4. Select a song from the list or upload your own MP3
5. Interact with the visualization using your mouse

## Browser Support

This project works best in modern browsers that support:
- WebGL
- Web Audio API
- MediaStream API
- ES6+ JavaScript features
